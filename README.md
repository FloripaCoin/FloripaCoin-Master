Coins awarded per block: this is the big difference in Floripacoin:
  - In the first 999,999 blocks (approx. 500 days) coins awarded per block is 10,000 FLN
  - However, every 1000 blocks (2 times a day) starts a sequence of 21 special blocks, and the first 20 coins will randomly between 500 and 50,000, and block 21 will give fixed value of 50,000
  - Between blocks 1,000,000 and 2,999,999 a block reward is 10,000, and will be halved every 733,394 blocks (approx 1 year)
  - And from the block 3,000,000 will give fixed value of 600 FLN
